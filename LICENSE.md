In the letter of the law, this software inherits at least the GPLv3, as the dependent libraries are GPLv3.

That said, the spirit of my intent is that this software not be encumbered materially or otherwise, except 
inasmuch that the list of contributors at the top of the file remains intact in the source of any directly
derivative works.

I don't really care what you do with it, as long as you don't claim to own it exclusively.


Cheers :)
